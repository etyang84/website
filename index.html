			Being a student of <b>Software Engineering</b> building websites is among the roles one should be
			able to do with much ease.
		<br>
			
		Among many things I like is taking a walk 
		mostly when am done with my day's errands .
	<br>
		This sometimes comes along with a thing to learn ,a situation to experience
		or even getting an old friend along the way and most strangely finding a new friend.
